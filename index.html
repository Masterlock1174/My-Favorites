    <h2>Water</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a
      transparent, tasteless, odorless,[c] and nearly colorless chemical
      substance, and it is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the
      fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent). It
      is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food energy or
      organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of
      its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by
      covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an
      angle of 104.45°. "Water" is also the name of the liquid state of H2O at
      standard temperature and pressure. Because Earth's environment is
      relatively close to water's triple point, water exists on Earth as a
      solid, a liquid, and a gas. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and
      aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water
      and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may
      precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or
      water vapor. Water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, with seas and
      oceans making up most of the water volume (about 96.5%). Small portions of
      water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of
      Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds
      (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation
      (0.001%). Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation,
      transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and
      runoff, usually reaching the sea. Water plays an important role in the
      world economy. Approximately 70% of the fresh water used by humans goes to
      agriculture. Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies has been, and
      continues to be, a major source of food for many parts of the world,
      providing 6.5% of global protein. Much of the long-distance trade of
      commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is
      transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large
      quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating in
      industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of
      substances, both mineral and organic; as such, it is widely used in
      industrial processes and in cooking and washing. Water, ice, and snow are
      also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as
      swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving,
      ice skating, snowboarding, and skiing.

    <h2>Mantis Shrimp</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mantis shrimp are carnivorous marine crustaceans of the order Stomatopoda
      (from Ancient Greek στόμα (stóma) 'mouth', and ποδός (podós) 'foot').
      Stomatopods branched off from other members of the class Malacostraca
      around 340 million years ago. Mantis shrimp typically grow to around 10 cm
      (3.9 in) in length, while a few can reach up to 38 cm (15 in). A mantis
      shrimp's carapace covers only the rear part of the head and the first four
      segments of the thorax. Varieties range in colour from shades of brown to
      vivid colours, with more than 520 species of mantis shrimp known. They are
      among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and
      subtropical marine habitats. However, despite being common, they are
      poorly understood, as many species spend most of their lives sheltering in
      burrows and holes. Called "sea locusts" by ancient Assyrians, "prawn
      killers" in Australia, and now sometimes referred to as "thumb
      splitters"—because of the animal's ability to inflict painful wounds if
      handled incautiously—mantis shrimp have powerful raptorial appendages that
      are used to attack and kill prey either by spearing, stunning, or
      dismembering. Some mantis shrimp species have specialised calcified
      'clubs' that can strike with great power, while others have sharp
      forelimbs used to seize the prey (hence the term "mantis" in their common
      name).

    <h2>Chessboxing</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Chess boxing, or chessboxing, is a hybrid sport that combines two
      traditional disciplines: chess and boxing. Two combatants play alternating
      rounds of blitz chess and boxing until one wins by checkmate or knockout.
      It is also possible to win by time penalty as in normal chess, and by
      boxing decision if there is a draw in the chess round. Typically, events
      are held in a standard boxing ring using standard amateur boxing equipment
      and rules. The chess round is also played in the ring with the table,
      board, and seating being moved in and out of the ring for each round. The
      governing bodies of chessboxing are the World Chessboxing Association and
      the World Chess Boxing Organisation. Chessboxing was invented by French
      comic book artist Enki Bilal and adapted by Dutch performance artist Iepe
      Rubingh as an art performance and has subsequently grown into a
      competitive sport. Chessboxing is particularly popular in the United
      Kingdom, India, Finland, France, and Russia.

    <h3>I love chessboxing because:</h3>
    <ul>
      You get CTE in a sport that requires heavy thinking and pattern
      recognition.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Chessboxers sometimes seem as though they don't know what is happening,
      and I can relate to that.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      The creator of chessboxing often resorted to picking up random people off
      the street with zero experience (often unkown germans) and destroying
      them.
